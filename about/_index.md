Statistician by career, I love cooking, I love travelling and I love to follow a fit and healthy lifestyle. 

Exploring new places, preferably beach, is my idea of a good vacation.
When at home, nothing beats the idea of trying out new recipes and serving them to the family.
I like to do Yoga to keep myself fit.

[ChilliClove.com](http://www.chilliclove.com) is my attempt to pen down recipes I learned and liked. I would also be reviewing some of the great places which I have travelled to in and out of India. I will also take a shot to share my idea of good and healthy lifestyle.
